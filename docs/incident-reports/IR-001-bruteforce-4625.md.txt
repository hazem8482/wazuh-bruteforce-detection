# IR-001 — Suspected Brute Force (Windows Event ID 4625)

## Summary
Multiple Windows failed logon events were generated in a short time window, indicating brute-force style behavior.

## Detection
- Wazuh base rule: **60122** — Logon Failure (unknown user / bad password)
- Windows event: **4625** (Failed logon)
- Custom elevated rule: **100501** (Level **12**)

## Evidence (Lab)
- Agent: Windows VM
- Observed fields:
  - TargetUserName: Administrator
  - IpAddress: 127.0.0.1 (local test)
- Wazuh displayed repeated authentication failures and raised the custom alert.

## Impact
No successful authentication occurred (failed logons only). Activity was generated in an isolated lab environment.

## Recommendations (Real World)
- Enable account lockout policy + strong password policy
- Alert on repeated failed logons by user/IP
- Investigate source host/process and block suspicious IPs when applicable
